        Dear Mr. Kleinhans,
        <br><br>
        We are saddened to hear that you are leaving us, but we want to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude for everything you have done for us during your time here at our school. Your dedication and enthusiasm for teaching physics and computer science have inspired us all, and we are grateful for the impact you have had on our lives.
        <br><br>
        Your "Feel Good Fridays" speeches always brightened up our week, and your kind and caring nature made our time in your class a truly memorable experience. We will miss your positive energy and unwavering commitment to helping us learn and grow.
        <br><br>
        We hope that you enjoy your well-deserved break, and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Thank you for being an amazing teacher and a wonderful person.
        <br><br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
